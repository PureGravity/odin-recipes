    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Chicken Wings</li>
        <li>Table Salt</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li><b>Optional:</b> Buffalo Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly season the chicken wings with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and thyme. For a deeper flavor, let the seasoning sit in the fridge for a few hours.</li>
        <li>Set your oven to 425Â°F. To get a nice crispy skin, cooking the chicken 15 minutes on each side at this temp is best.</li>
        <li><b>Optional:</b> When the wings are at proper temp, remove them from the oven and toss them in a bowl with buffalo sauce if you like a nice little kick!</li>
        <li>Serve wings with ranch or bleu cheese.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
