                <li>1 New York Strip</li>
                <li>Kosher Salt</li>
                <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
                <li>Garlic Powder</li>
                <li>1 Garlic Clove</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp Butter</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>
                Steps
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by seasoning the New York Strip generously on all sides with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Don't forget the sides! Let the steak sit in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes. Ideally, wait 2 hours for a deeper flavor.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet to 350Â°F, then pour in a tablespoon of grapeseed oil. Toss in the garlic with butter and wait for the butter to reach a brownish caramel color before putting in the steak.</li>
                <li>When ready, place the steak into the skillet and let it sit for 1 minute. Flip and repeat this process until the steak reaches a preferred level of doneness.</li>
                <li>When the steak is finished, pull it off the skillet, and pour the extra garlic-infused butter on top of the steak. Let the steak sit for 5 minutes, as it is still cooking!</li>
                <li>Serve with no steak sauce. Enjoy!</li>
